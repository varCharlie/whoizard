# WHOIZARD
`whoizard` is a program for checking whether or not domains are registered. It can read domains over stdin, from a file, or from a space seperated list provided as an option.

I made `whoizard` because manually checking if domain names are registered can be tedious. The output of whoizard is each domain names expiration date, or a string letting you know the domain doesn't exist yet.
